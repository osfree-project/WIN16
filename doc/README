4.	[REQUIRED]

	Run Time Configuration.
	-----------------------

	Create a twin runtime configuration file, in your home directory.
	The following is an example of a configuration file. You can modify
	it to suite your environment.

		[boot]
		control=0x1000
		windows=/willows/twin/windows
		openpath=/willows/bin/win:/willows/bin/demo

	This file is a standard windows .ini file, with 1 required section,
	the [boot] section.  This section allows you to set the following:

		control		This variable controls certain runtime
				configuration switches.  The default setting
				of 0x1000 is useful for running Microsoft
				Office Applications.  For more information
				on this file, see the file ./win/compat.h.
				NOTE: This variable should NOT have to be 	
				modified to run applications, and will not
				normally be used by users.


		windows		This variable points to where the microsoft
				windows directory is located, this is where
				C:\WINDOWS is located, if available.  This
				is where we will search for .ini files, and
				one of the locations we will search when 					running an application from the command line. 	
				It should be the standard unix path to the
				windows directory.  It is also used to find
				the system directory underneath it to find
				and installed windows dll's.

		openpath	This colon separated list is equivalent to
				the PATH variable under windows and unix.
				Since no windows applications will be under
				the unix PATH, this variable allows you to
				set the path to where you keep windows
				executables only.

	See the files:
		./template/readme.twinrc for more information, and file
		./template/sample.twinrc for an example file.


7.	[OPTIONAL (tracing binary applications)

	Enabling TRACE output of the debug library.
	-------------------------------------------

	To enable the library to trace api calls made by an application,
	you can use the WIN_OPENLOG variable.  If it is set to a log file, 
	the DEBUG versions of the library will log library trace information 
	to that file. 

		export WIN_OPENLOG=/tmp/log

	you can use "-" as the filename, to log to stdout.

	This file will give very comprehensive information about what is
	called, with its arguments and return values.  This can be invaluable
	in finding out why an application does not work.
