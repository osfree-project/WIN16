  This page gives information about floppies and hard disks as given by the
computer's BIOS.

  Floppies are numbered from 0 to 127, and hard drives from 128 to 255. A
PC/XT or clone may not give any information for floppies here. Most of the
information is self explanatory. There may appear to be more hard drives
shown than there actually is. This is normal. Many BIOS's support several
drives, and unused ones will have garbage data displayed.
