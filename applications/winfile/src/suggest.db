//
// Usage: Just add a new entry of the format:

// SUGGEST( resource_number, error-code, flags, "your-reason-string" )
//  resource_number = incremental number for string ID
//  error-code = error this suggestion corresponds to
//  "your-reason-string" string displayed for error
//  flags: SUG_IGN_FORMATMESSAGE = prepend system FormatMessage text

// Ok, so it's not perfect: your resource number can't clash
// with any others in winfile.h.  Use 1 .. 99 (1101 to 1199)
// resource # 0 is reserved.

// What it does:
// For system errors (defined here in winfile land as < DE_BEGIN (bit 29 off)),
// it puts the "suggestion" below the error text (a blank line is between
// them.
//
// For our errors (>= DE_BEGIN), it places the text below (1 blank line)
// the previous string.  There is no longer any corresponding text called
// "IDS_REASONS+DE_MYERROR" or "DE_MYERROR" in the resources.
// Internal error messages and their reasons must be stored here in
// the same string.
