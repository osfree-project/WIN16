Originally based on Steve Grant's Public Domain SYSID 4.44.

Usage:  [d:][path]INFOPLUS

A system description for DOS-based PC/XT/AT- and PS/2-class machines.
INFOPLUS generates 18 screens of information about the host system and
runs under DOS versions 3.0 and later.

My primary sources of ideas in INFOPLUS were Ray Duncans "Advanced MS-DOS"
and Terry Dettman's "DOS Programmer's Reference."  The ideas of Prakash
Chandra,Terje Mathisen,Bob Smith, and others appear in various places.
Also James Howard, John Levine, Mark Aitchison.

Some of the techniques INFOPLUS uses are not documented or officially
supported by either IBM or Microsoft.  Where possible I have followed
the undocumented routine with a comment describing my source for the
technique.

        INFOPLUS.PAS       - Main file source code
        PAGE_xx.INC        - Each of the pages
        INFOPLUS.ASM       - assembly language procedures
        INFOPLUS.PIF       - Windows 3 Program Information File
        INFOPLUS.ICO       - Icon for Windows 3 Program Manager

  Using INFOPLUS is easy. Just use the PGUP and PGDN keys to move from page
to page. HOME and END will move to the first and last pages, respectively.
If you hit ENTER, you can then type in the page you want to go to. Hit ESC
to end the program. Some pages won't fit all on one screen, for that you hit
the DOWN ARROW key to get more information. If you wish a hard copy, just
hit SHIFT-PrtSc or SHIFT-PRINT or PrintScrn, depending on your keyboard.
  If you have trouble with bad colors on the screen, try setting your computer
to MODE MONO or MODE BW80 before starting INFOPLUS. INFOPLUS will use a black
and white palette if either of these modes are detected.
  If you are in a 40 column mode, INFOPLUS will run in 80 column, but return
you back to 40 columns upon completion. 132 column modes are not supported
because Turbo Pascal's CRT unit only works with standard modes, and I don't
want to give up all the nice features.
  INFOPLUS does support more than 25 lines, although most of the pages are set
up to look best at 25 lines. Some display modes do not properly return the
correct number of lines.

WINDOWS 3.0 NOTES!!!
     You can add INFOPLUS to the Program Manager. Open the group that you
     want to put INFOPLUS in. Select File, New, Program item. Use whatever
     you want for the Description. For Command line, enter INFOPLUS.EXE,
     preceed with a drive and directory if not on your PATH. If you hit
     ENTER, and end up at the screen, select File, Properties. Hit Change
     Icon, and for the file name, use INFOPLUS.ICO. Then OK everything.


Personal info:

     My computer is a Gateway 2000 386/25 running MS-DOS 4.01, Windows 3,
     an ESDI drive, and an ATI VGA Wonder card.
     Compiled under Turbo Pascal 5.5 and Turbo Assembler 2.00.
     Much of the additional info came from Ray Duncan's "Advanced MSDOS
     Programming" second edition (a must get book for anyone interested
     in low-level stuff.) Also, additional information on the DOS 4 boot
     sector format came from "The Norton Troubleshooter." A book that
     comes with The Norton Utilities 4.5. Even more information comes from
     Ralf Brown's interrupt list, which lists hundreds of goodies. It's
     available via BBS's, and resides on SIMTEL20 and many other public
     access UNIX sites.
       Additional information on XMS and DPMI came from the book 'Extending
     DOS' by Ray Duncan (and others.)
       Information on additional partition values came from numerous people
     of which I never wrote down their names!!
       Information on detecting VGA chipsets came from "Advanced Programmer's
     Guide to Super VGAs" by George Sutty and Steve Blair. Published by Brady.
       Information on reading the CMOS came from a program posted by Mark
     Aitchison on USENET.
