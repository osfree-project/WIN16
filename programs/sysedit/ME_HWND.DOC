Fix Bug Referencing Destroyed Window Handle

In WinMain, after the message loop has terminated, previously the code
would quit WinHelp and destroy the frame window both referencing the
frame window handle which has already been destroyed.  This change
deletes the spurious call to DestroyWindow () and moves the call to
quit WinHelp to the WM_CLOSE message of the frame window (just before
it calls DestroyWindow).

MAXEDIT.C	Delete spurious call to DestroyWindow ().
		Move call to Winhelp (Quit) to WM_CLOSE of frame
		  window procedure.
