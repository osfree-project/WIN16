* Replace the stolen PrintFile function with one that wraps lines.

 Description: Replace the stolen PrintFile function with one that wraps lines.
     I stole the aforesaid function for CYA and made it wrap lines. I have
     moved that code, with a bit of retrofit, back into Maxedit so it now
     wraps lines instead of truncating them. Also fixed a bug in 
     GetSaveFileName call where the lpszFileTitle was not nulled before
     the call.
