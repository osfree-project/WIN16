* Fix print function. Print more than one file. Save setup.

 Description: The PrintDlg function was failing the second time because
     the devmode and devname handles were being freed but the variables
     were not being cleared to zero. On second thought, moved the freeing
     to the program exit so changes made in Printer Setup are remembered
     and you don't have to do a setup before printing each and every file.
