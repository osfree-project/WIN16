Message Conventions -

    FS_CHANGEDISPLAY:
        This message causes the window to alter the contents of what it's
        displaying.  It is valid for Directory and Search Results windows.
        There isn't a return value.

        wParam  -   Indicates the type of change being made:
                        CD_PATH -   Changes the path Directory window
                                    displays including a filespec
                                    with wildcards.  Valid only for
                                    Directory windows.  lParam points
                                    to the new path.  If lParam is
                                    NULL, this is the REFRESH command.

                        CD_VIEW -   LOWORD(lParam) contains the new
                                    set of view flags.  Valid only for
                                    Directory windows.

                        CD_SORT -   LOWORD(lParam) contains the new
                                    sort flags.

        lParam  -   Depends upon the setting of wParam.


    FS_GETDIRECTORY:
        This message stores the window's current directory in the buffer
        pointed to by lParam.  It is valid for the Tree and Directory MDI
        windows.  The path is returned in upper case and always ends with
        a backslash.

            ex.:    "E:\PRE\", "C:\"

        wParam  -   Maximum length of string
        lParam  -   LPTSTR to buffer will contain the directory path


    FS_GETDRIVE:

        current drive.  It is valid for Tree and Directory MDI windows.
        The letter is returned in upper case.

            ex.:    'C', 'A'

        wParam  -   Unused
        lParam  -   Unused

    FS_GETSELECTION:

        string is returned upper case.  No path info in included unless
        a directory is selected.  The directories includes full path info
        and NOT terminated with backslash.

        The HIWORD of the return is a BOOL indicating if the last selected
        item is a directory or not.

            ex.:    "FOO.TXT LOO.LOO E:\DIR"

Variable Conventions -

    Window Words -
        Each MDI Child window has the following extra bytes allocated with it:

            GWW_VIEW    -   The "current" view flags for the window
            GWW_SORT    -   The "current" sort flags for the window
            GWW_ATTRIBS -   The "current" attributes to display

                Note: The Tree window contains the "System Wide" versions
                      of these flags.  The Search window is hard coded
                      to VIEW_NAMEONLY, IDM_BYNAME, and ATTR_DEFAULT.

        In addition, MDI children have the following extra bytes which are
        specific to them:

            GWW_HWNDLB  -   (Directory) The hwnd of the window's list box
            GWW_HDTA    -   (Directory) The handle of the directories DTA list
