This is a Program Manager for WINE.

There is a checksum in the Microsoft `*.grp' files. I don't know how
to calculate it (1). Therefore the group files written by this Program Manager
cannot be used with the Microsoft Program Manager!!! checksum calculated easely

To prevent overwriting original files:
If there is an existing `*.grp' file this program uses the extension
`.gr' instead. !!! subject to remove



1) Information about checksum calculation can be found in https://books.google.ru/books?id=LIyy_CtozLcC&lpg=PP1&hl=ru&pg=PP2#v=onepage&q&f=false PCMag 12 Jan 1993
