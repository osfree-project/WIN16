USER.EXE internals

USER.EXE consist of 3 code segments (2 for code and one only for debug version) and set of heaps.

Heaps are:

1. Main user heap, selected by SetUserHeapDS()
2. Global Atom table head, selected by SetGlobalTableDS()

Other heaps not implemented yet, but in plans to implement.

So, you must be carefull and set corresponding heap and restore application heap on exit.

PushDS - saves current data segment (heap)
PopDS - restores current data segment (heap)

Set*DS - sets corresponding heap for access

Also need to be sure all locked structures unlocked after use

Metrics:

For now exists some global variables and system metrics. For optimal memory usage and performance better to implement 
direct access to metrics array. For now variables accessed via standard GetSystemMetrics.
